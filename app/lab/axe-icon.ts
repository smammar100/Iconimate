// Phosphor "axe" (regular, 256 grid) — a handle running from the lower-left grip up to
// a blade at the top-right. It's one shape, so we keep it whole and swing it as a rigid
// body. The natural pivot for a chop is the grip (the rounded handle butt, ≈28,200);
// rotating there arcs the blade down. The blade's cutting edge lands near (180,150).
